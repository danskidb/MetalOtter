## Progress
https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Depth_buffering

## Goals
- render texture in both windows separately, one with ImGui
- no vsync, but frame limiter
- investigate matchmaking + networking solution for turn based game
- dedicated server library

## Todo
- iOS and Android compatibility
- entity hierarchy
- better sdl event handling (only send keyboard events etc to currently focussed window)
- better handling for High DPI screens (SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI)
- change all window size things to Vec2D
